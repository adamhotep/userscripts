This is Adam Katz's collection of [UserScripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) for [Greasemonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey) ([install on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)), [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) ([install on Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)) and similar website modifiers.

To install, first get a userscript add-on for your browser, then view the code for the desired script. Click the **Raw** button at the top right of the code to engage the add-on for installation. Then load (or reload) a page it affects.

Some of these are old enough to have previously existed at the now-defunct userscripts.org.  See also [this 2014 archive of my userscripts.org scripts](http://userscripts-mirror.org/users/41779/scripts).
